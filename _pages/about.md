I am a Second-year graduate student in mechanical engineering at [ZheJiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), where I am being advised by Prof. Jin Wang.

My research lies in Computer Vision. I am particularly interested in large generative models for visual content generation and understanding. I also worked on freehand sketch understanding and recognition. 

In the past, my work extended to the field of human-computer interaction.
